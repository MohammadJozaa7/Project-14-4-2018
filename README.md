# Project-14-4-2018
  first project I will do

the idea:
 get the user info fro face book

main folder:
  1- front end: client folder (Angular)
  2- back end: server folder (Express)
  3- data base: database folder (Mongoodb)

step I did it:
  1- must make folder / files 
    server: index.js
    client
    database
  
  2- make our npm test file ready (package.json)
    by run command (npm init --yes)
  
  3- put all thing we need inside (package.json)
    by run the command (npm install <package_name>)
    or with (--save) to save it on the file (package.json)
    so we need: express / angular / mongodb
    and we will see it in package.json 
  
  4- go to the index and make the basic thing on our page
    some change in the html to see the thing

  5- connect the index with the server and open the server
    by (node +the name of file for server) when you are
    inside the folder contains the server file = [index.js]

    and to make the server restart each time when save
    we need to install nodemon
    and to open server go to directory have the file index.js
    and run command (nodemon +the name of file for server) 
    when you are inside the folder contains the server 
    file = [index.js] 

    and to connect the server.js with our index.html
    we must use the thing in server I ame command for it
  
  6- start make the front end (angular) to do somthing when press the button 
    the buttun make a post request for the info for the user
    in face book (front end/back end/show data )
    1.when press the button do something in angular:
    ng-click="PostData() -- in html
    (app.controller code) -- in controller
    and connect this file controller with HTML file
    we can install by (npm install -g @angular/cli)

    in file src dont use / first (like inestead of)
  
  7- try to make it in react:
    npm install -g webpack
    npm install

    now in seperated window:
    npm run react-dev
    npm run server-dev
 
  8- now conenct the api for facebook and the token
