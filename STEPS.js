/*
the idea:
1- front end: client folder (Angular)
2- back end: server folder (Express)
3- data base: database folder (Mongoodb)

1- must make folder / files 
 server: server.js
 client
 db
 index.html (main page)

2- make our npm test file ready (package.json)
  by run command (npm init --yes)

3- put all thing we need inside (package.json)
  by run the command (npm install <package_name>)
  or with (--save) to save it on the file (package.json)
  so we need: express / angular / mongodb
  and we will see it in package.json 

4- go to the index and make the basic thing on our page
  some change in the html to see the thing
5- now connect the index with the server and open the server
